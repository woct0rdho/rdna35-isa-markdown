# RDNA 3.5 ISA Markdown

I've converted it from PDF to Markdown so you don't have to.

The original document is at https://docs.amd.com/v/u/en-US/rdna35_instruction_set_architecture . I converted it using [Marker](https://github.com/datalab-to/marker).

The format is intended for AI to search and retrieve local pieces. There are Markdown syntax errors, so it's not suitable for an actual Markdown renderer to render the whole document.

Of course I did not proofread so there can be errors and missings, but it seems to work.

There is also machine-readable XML at https://gpuopen.com/machine-readable-isa/ , but it does not have so much explanatory context as the manual. I recommend to let AI first search in the manual to understand what to look at, then search in the XML for formal definitions.
