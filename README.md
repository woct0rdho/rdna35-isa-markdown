# RDNA 3.5 ISA Markdown

I've converted it from PDF to Markdown so you don't have to.

The original document is at https://docs.amd.com/v/u/en-US/rdna35_instruction_set_architecture . I converted it using [Marker](https://github.com/datalab-to/marker), then converted the PDF into images, and proofread page by page using Kimi K2.5 in OpenCode. There can be errors and missings, but it seems to work.

The format is intended for AI to search and semantically understand, rather than being displayed in a Markdown viewer. Underscores are deliberately not escaped to help search identifiers.

There is also machine-readable XML at https://gpuopen.com/machine-readable-isa/ , but it does not have so much explanatory context as the manual. I recommend to let AI first search in the manual to understand what to look at, then search in the XML for formal definitions. I hope AMD can publish the manual in an AI-readable format, such as in TeX or HTML.
